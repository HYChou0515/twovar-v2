As we do it in parallel, the time is not meaningful.
Don't use it to plot time.

Because semigd with random is the best with r=0.5,
we commented out all r!=0.5
./plot.py --logpath ../log/ cd

Using SemiGD+random, when r is not good, the performence is bad.
Can comment out the Original SemiGD, either PG or DualObj, 
also comment out r=0.95,0.99,
change marker in expconf.py to 
	MARKER = ["--","--","--","--","--","--","--","o-.","o-."]
and see how performence changes while r changes.
